*   **Unlimited Sources:** Add as many RSS feed URLs as you need via a native Custom Post Type interface.
*   **Unified Dashboard:** View items from all your sources in one clean, sortable administration table.
*   **Intelligent Parsing:** Automatically prioritizes full-text content (`<content:encoded>`) over simple descriptions for better AI context.
*   **Performance First:** Built-in caching with the Transients API ensures your dashboard loads instantly without hammering external APIs.

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Content Rewriting**
*   **Unsensored AI:** Powered by Venice.ai's private uncensored model for high quality uncensored text generation.
*   **One-Click Magic:** Click "Rewrite & Publish" on any feed item to generate a fresh draft in seconds.
*   **Custom Personas:** Define your own system prompts (e.g., *"Rewrite this as a witty tech blogger"* or *"Summarize for a corporate audience"*) in the settings.
*   **Context Aware:** The AI reads the source HTML to understand headers and formatting before rewriting.

### 🎛️ **Curator Workflow**
*   **Filtering:** Easily filter the dashboard view by specific feed sources (e.g., view only "TechCrunch" or "BBC").
*   **Duplicate Prevention:** Visual indicators show exactly which articles have already been imported to prevent duplicate content.
